## Submission for SWE 550 HW1

I spent more than 20 hours to learn the jvm and asm internal mechanics. 
However I couldn't come up with a solution by myself. Therfore I peeked the
implementation of Google resides in this address
 
(Link to Implementation)[https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/master/lint/libs/lint-checks/src/main/java/com/android/tools/lint/checks/ControlFlowGraph.java]

With the help of this I can print out a CFG however, I cannot reduce it more.
I did it just to show some effort. I am unable to implement tests due to deadline restriction


Best Regards.
